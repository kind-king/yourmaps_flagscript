# YourMAPS FlagScript


YourMAPS Flagscript 

A flag system for **RedM**, created to fill the gap in available scripts that allow players to equip and interact with flags as in-game items.

This system enables players to carry, drop, and pick up flags in an immersive and configurable way. 
It supports full integration with item-based frameworks, animations, prompts, and a wide selection of customizable flags.

- Drop and pick up flags with keybinds

Installation

    Place the folder yourmaps_flags inside your RedM resources.
