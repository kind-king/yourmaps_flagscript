# YourMAPS FlagScript



A flag system for **RedM**, created to fill the gap in available scripts that allow players to equip and interact with flags as in-game items.

This system enables players to carry, drop, and pick up flags in an immersive and configurable way. 
It supports full integration with item-based frameworks, animations, prompts, and a wide selection of customizable flags.
