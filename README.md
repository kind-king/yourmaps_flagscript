# YourMAPS FlagScript

A flag system for **RedM**, created to fill the gap in available scripts that allow players to equip and interact with flags as in-game items.

This system enables players to carry, drop, and pick up flags in an immersive and configurable way. 
It supports full integration with item-based frameworks, animations, prompts, and a wide selection of customizable flags.

## Supported Frameworks

- ✅ **REDEMRP** (fully integrated with item usage and jobs)
- ✅ **VORP** (with built-in prompt support)
